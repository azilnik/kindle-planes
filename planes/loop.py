"""The screen loop every frame shares: wake, fetch over Wi-Fi when due, draw, push to the
e-ink panel, sleep, and the night and low-battery rest. A frame (planes.py, sky.py)
supplies the data and the pictures; this owns timing, power and Wi-Fi recovery, which
were hard won on the device (docs/power.md).

A frame is an object with:
    configure(args)          re-read config.json (every loop, so edits apply live) and return
                             the settings this needs: power, rotate, style, frontlight
    fetch(session, now)      pull its data; raise requests.RequestException or ValueError
                             when the fetch as a whole failed
    fetch_every(now)         seconds until the next fetch after a good one
    render(now, fetched_at)  the picture, on the landscape canvas (fetched_at 0 = never)
    moving(now)              True while the picture changes minute to minute; otherwise
                             the loop sleeps until the next fetch
    in_night(now), next_morning(now)
                             the quiet hours, when nothing is fetched
    night_key(now, mode)     redraw the rest picture whenever this changes
    render_night(now, mode)  that picture; mode is "night", or "low" on a dying battery
and `fetch_log` and `log`, dicts of fields for the power log's fetch and draw lines.
Optionally `idle_redraw_s`: the longest a still picture waits for a redraw when the next
fetch is further off than that (the sky turns even when nothing needs fetching). The loop
sets `plugged` on the frame each round, so it can fetch faster on a charger. Optionally
`next_due(now)`: when its next fetch falls due, so the morning after the quiet hours
waits for it rather than joining Wi-Fi with nothing to fetch (the sky frame computes
most of what it shows; planes always has something to fetch by morning).

Plugged in, battery doesn't matter: Wi-Fi stays up (SSH works without the power button),
the Kindle never suspends, and the picture redraws every minute. Anything on a shared rate
limit keeps its pace; that's up to the frame's fetch_every.

A frame can make that calmer with two optional hooks:
    screen_key()  what the last render says, as a value; the first item its headline
    mood(now)     "calm", "soon" (something good within the half hour) or "live"
Then, plugged in, it still checks every minute but the screen only changes when what it
says does, or every 15 minutes as the sky turns; while it's "live", every 15 seconds. A full
flash only on a new headline, when something starts or ends, or once enough partial updates
leave ghosts.

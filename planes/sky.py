"""The sky frame: everything above the house. The sky as a map seen from above, like the
planes map: straight overhead in the middle, the horizon at the rim, the way you face
(config "heading") at the top. On it the nearest weather balloon, the ISS, Tiangong and
fresh Starlink trains, the Moon, planets and the brightest stars; beside it a headline for
the one thing worth looking up for, and in quiet moments a key of how far away each is.

Data: satellite orbits from CelesTrak once a day, and balloons from SondeHub around the
twice-daily launches (Buffalo's, from Toronto) and every few hours. Wi-Fi goes on only for those. The Sun, Moon, planets and
stars are computed on the device, so the sky still draws with no network at all.

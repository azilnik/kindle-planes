# Power

Measured on a PW4 on battery. `tools/battery.py power.log` prints these numbers from the
device's log.

| Setup | Draw | Per charge |
|---|---|---|
| Kindle UI stopped, Wi-Fi always on, redraw every 20 s | ~84 mA | ~18 h |
| Suspend between redraws, Wi-Fi only for fetches | 20.5 mA | ~3 days |
| Plus waiting for the e-ink refresh and Wi-Fi teardown before suspend | 13.5 mA | ~5 days |
| In the frame, day-to-day | ~11 mA | ~5.5 days |

## What the loop does

- Redraws every minute from dead-reckoned positions: last track × ground speed, altitude
  following the vertical rate. A fix older than 11 minutes is dropped rather than guessed.
- Fetches every 10 minutes; every 5 when the featured plane is below 10,000 ft or about to
  leave the map; every 15 when the sky is empty. Wi-Fi is on only for the fetch. Routes and
  aircraft types for the next few candidate planes are looked up in the same window.
- Suspends to RAM between, woken by the SoC RTC (`rtc1`; `rtc0` doesn't wake a PW4).
- Night: one drawing, Wi-Fi off, no redraws until morning, a no-op wake every 30 minutes.
- Near-empty battery: parks on the night drawing, since e-ink keeps the last image after
  power is gone. Comes back at 10% or on a charger.

## What each fix was worth

A frame went from ~1.5 s to ~0.35 s of awake time: cache rasterised text and rotated
icons, write PGM instead of PNG (7 ms instead of 500), transpose instead of rotate.

Suspending while the screen was still refreshing hung the kernel about every 7th sleep and
the watchdog rebooted the Kindle every ~12 minutes. `fbink -w` (wait for the panel) and
waiting for `wifid` to drop before suspending fixed it.

`wifid` can lose the network overnight and never retry. Failures escalate: radio cycle every
3rd failure, restart `wifid` after about an hour, reboot after about three.

Fetches used to fail when `wifid` reported connected before the link carried traffic. The
fetch now retries twice within the same wake instead of paying for another Wi-Fi join.

adsb.lol is fetched over plain HTTP on purpose: it's public position data, and a TLS
handshake costs the Kindle's CPU about a second of awake time every fetch.
